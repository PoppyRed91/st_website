          The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) was a 23rd century Federation Constitution-class 
          starship operated by Starfleet, and the first Federation starship to bear the name 
          Enterprise. During its career, the Enterprise served as the Federation flagship 
          and was in service from 2245 to 2285. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The Enterprise was launched on April 11, 2245, under the command of Captain April.
          In 2250, April left the Enterprise and command was turned over to Pike.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2265 command of the Enterprise would be transferred 
          to James Kirk. The Enterprise would also be assigned to another five-year mission of 
          deep space exploration. The ship's primary goal during this mission was to seek out 
          and contact alien life. The Enterprise underwent major refit into what would later 
          be known as the Constitution II-class. The refitting took eighteen months of work, 
          and essentially a new vessel was built onto the bones of the old, replacing virtually 
          every major system. This ensured Enterprise's continued service for the next several years, 
          enabling the her to continue to serve in its prominent role.
          <br>
          <br>
          Captain Kirk set the auto-destruct sequence when the ship was disabled by Klingon Bird
          of Prey. Being forty years old at the time of its destruction, the Enterprise had surpassed its 
          designer's original projected eighteen-year endurance by twenty-two years.

        <div class="section-description">
          The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) was a Federation Galaxy-class starship operated by 
          Starfleet, and the fifth Federation vessel to bear the name. The Enterprise served from 
          2363 to 2371 as the Federation flagship, under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.
          <br>
          <br>
          On stardate 40759.5, in the year 2363, the Enterprise was launched from Mars and started its 
          eight-year mission. The Borg, Q and other prominent species were first encountered by 
          Enterprise D crew.
          <br>
          <br> 
          An engagement with a renegade Klingon Bird-of-Prey commanded by the Duras 
          sisters in 2371 resulted in extensive damage to the Enterprise leading to an unavoidable warp core breach 
          at Veridian III. Ship was destroyed but it was rebuilt as a museum ship, and was briefly brought 
          back into service to counter a Borg threat in 2401.

        <div class="section-description">
          The USS Voyager (NCC-74656) was a 24th century Federation Intrepid-class starship operated by 
          Starfleet from 2371 to 2378. Her captain was Kathryn Janeway. Voyager was famous for completing 
          an unscheduled seven-year journey across the Delta Quadrant, the first successful exploration of 
          that quadrant by the Federation, as well as numerous technological innovations and first contacts.
          <br>
          <br>
          Voyager was one of the earliest Intrepid-class starships constructed and it featured a number of 
          technological innovations that had become available in the 2370s: bio-neural circuitry, variable 
          geometry warp nacelles, and an Emergency Medical Holographic program were only a few of Voyager's 
          notable technical advancements. The vessel was also the first to test the class 9 warp drive in 
          deep space. It was the first ship in a long line to bear the name Voyager with this registry.
          <br>
          <br>
          Following its return to the Alpha Quadrant, Voyager was decommissioned from active duty and 
          taken to a facility in the Portelo system to be converted into a museum ship.

        <div id="defiant" class="section-heading">USS Defiant NX-74205</div>
        <div class="section-description">
          The USS Defiant (NX-74205) was a 24th century Federation Defiant-class starship operated by Starfleet. 
          This was the prototype of the class and the second Federation ship known to bear the name Defiant.
          <br>
          <br>
          Development on the Defiant began around 2366 in response to the Borg threat to the Federation. After 
          initial and hostile first contact with the Borg, Starfleet did what it hadn't done in decades, place 
          greater emphasis on Starfleet's essential role in the defense of the Federation. Drafting plans for 
          such a defense required a starship capable of fighting against the Borg. The Defiant did not perform 
          well in its initial trial runs. The vessel was overpowered and over-gunned for a ship of its size, so 
          much so that the Defiant nearly shook itself apart when the engines were tested at full power.
          <br>
          <br>
          Commander Benjamin Sisko, who served on the team that designed the Defiant, requested that the vessel 
          be pulled out of storage and assigned to Deep Space 9 to counter a new threat of the Dominion. 
          The vessel was officially launched in 2370, on Stardate 47538.5, from the Antares Ship Yards. 
          The Defiant was equipped with an ablative armor coating that was designed to disintegrate under enemy 
          fire at a controlled rate. She also had a cloaking device. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The Defiant's short but illustrious career came to an end in mid-2375. Shortly after joining the 
          war on the side of the Dominion, the Breen retook the Chin'toka system using a new form of energy-dampening weapon. 
          The Defiant, along with 310 other allied vessels, was destroyed during the battle.
